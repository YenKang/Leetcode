> Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

>A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

#### Example:

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

#### Explanation:

- Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 

- Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
 
- Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Think process:

step1:先從上下左右四條邊開紙做dfs的traverse，如果遇到'O'就把它變成‘#'

step2:兩層loop，run全部的cell，若遇到'O'就翻成'X'

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    int m;
    int n;
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        if(board == null || board.length == 0) return;
        m = board.length ;
        n = board[0].length ;
        // check first col and the last col
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            if(board[i][0]=='O'){
                dfs(board,i,0);
            } 
            if(board[i][n-1]=='O'){
                dfs(board,i,n-1);
            } 
        }
        
        // check first raw and the last raw
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
            if(board[0][j]=='O'){
                dfs(board,0,j);
            } 
            if(board[m-1][j]=='O'){
                dfs(board,m-1,j);
            }
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(board[i][j]=='O'){
                    board[i][j]= 'X';
                }
                else if(board[i][j]=='#'){
                    board[i][j]= 'O';
                }
            }
        }   
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j){
        if(i<0 || j<0 || i>=m || j>=n || board[i][j]!='O'){
            return;
        }
        board[i][j]='#';
        dfs(board,i-1, j);
        dfs(board,i+1, j);
        dfs(board,i, j+1);
        dfs(board,i, j-1);
    }
    
}
```
