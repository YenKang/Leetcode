>Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 

#### Example:

- Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
- Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]

#### Note: 

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- The words are always separated by a single space.

### Follow up: 
- Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?

### Think process:
其實要解這題，應該是先解完[557. Reverse Words in a String III](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/)，
這題概念是如何翻轉each word in a String，這一長串string內，有空格，必須排空，然後調整翻轉的位置。

- 而本題就是，翻轉整個array ＋ 翻轉各個word

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
        // reverse the whole array
        reverse(s, 0, s.length-1);
        // reverse each word
        int cur =0;
        int start = 0;
        while(cur<s.length){
            // reverse current word
            if(s[cur]==' '){
                reverse(s, start, cur-1);
                start = cur+1;  
            }
            else if(cur==s.length-1){
                reverse(s, start, cur);
            }
            cur++;
        }    
    }
    public void reverse(char[] s, int l, int r){
        while(l<r){
            char temp = s[l];
            s[l++]=s[r];
            s[r--]=temp;
        }
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis


```
Time complexity: O(N), it's two passes along the string.

Space complexity: O(1), it's a constant space solution.
```


### Result:
- Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.57% of Java online submissions for Reverse Words in a String II.
- Memory Usage: 47.1 MB, less than 23.63% of Java online submissions for Reverse Words in a String II.
