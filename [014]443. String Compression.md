## [014]443. String Compression

##### problem link:https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

- If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
 
##### Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

##### Example 1:

> - Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
> - Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
> - Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

##### Example 2:

> - Input: chars = ["a"]
> - Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
> - Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

##### Example 4:

> - Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
> - Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
> - Explanation: The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.

##### Constraints:

- 1 <= chars.length <= 2000
- chars[i] is a lower-case English letter, upper-case English letter, digit, or symbol.

### 思路：
- 利用count and say的方式，對於字串的次數做count計算，但是code解法我仍舊參考他人的

### code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
       int resultIndex=0;
       int index =0;

       while(index <chars.length){
          char curChar = chars[index];
          int count =1;
          // 重複字串，例如:"aaa"

          while(index+1<chars.length && curChar == chars[index+1]){
            index++;
            count++;
          }
          //System.out.println("resultIndex1:"+resultIndex);
          chars[resultIndex++] = curChar;
          index++;
        
          if(count==1) continue;

          for(char countChar:String.valueOf(count).toCharArray()){
            chars[resultIndex++] = countChar;
          }
       }

       return resultIndex;
    }   
}
```
