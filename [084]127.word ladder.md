> Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

> Only one letter can be changed at a time.
> Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
> Note:

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

#### Example 1:

- Input:
    - beginWord = "hit",
    - endWord = "cog",
- wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
- Output: 5
- Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",return its length 5.
#### Example 2:

- Input:
    - beginWord = "hit"
    - endWord = "cog"
- wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
- Output: 0
- Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

###  Think process:
起初，我想沒有想到用bfs的方式，並且用queue的資料結構去放置data，只是寫一些零碎的判斷式，但看過[贾考博 LeetCode 127. Word Ladder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fzUFMpGLMU&ab_channel=JacobHuang)，
發現這個shorted path distance的算法，很像tree的拓展，然後求level的高度，
> - step1:store data into the HashSet and Queue

> - step2:run the beginword firstly and iterate each characters in this word // "hot"
> 
> - step3:check wordList has the changed word and equals to the endString

> - step4:remember to delete the temp changed word if the word is in the set

### code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(beginWord);
        int level=1;
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int qSize =queue.size();
            for(int i=0;i<qSize;i++){
                String curS = queue.poll();
                // run each character  with a-z chars
                for(int j=0;j<curS.length();j++){
                    char[] charArray = curS.toCharArray();
                    for(char x='a';x<='z';x++){
                        charArray[j] = x; // hot -> aot
                        // aot -> "aot"
                        String temp = new String(charArray); 
                        // check wordList has "aot"
                        if(set.contains(temp)){
                            if(temp.equals(endWord)){
                                return level+1;
                            } 
                            queue.add(temp);
                            set.remove(temp);
                        }   
                    }
                }
            }
            
            level++;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
