## [011]167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in **ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:
- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

###### Example 1:

- Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
- Output: [1,2]
- Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

###### Example 2:

- Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
- Output: [1,3]


###### Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- 1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- nums is sorted in increasing order.
- -1000 <= target <= 1000

#### 思路：
- 起初想到的就是用two pointers方式來實作，起初一直失敗，後來才發現是i<numbers.length-1 但j<numbers.length兩者去做邊界的定義。

#### 程式碼


```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int[] output = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<numbers.length-1;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<numbers.length;j++){
                if( numbers[i]+numbers[j]==target){
                    output[0]=i+1;
                    output[1]=j+1;
                }
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
}
```
