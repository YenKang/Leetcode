> Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

#### Note:

> Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.

> In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

#### Follow up:

- If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

 

#### Example 1:

- Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
- Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
- Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
#### Example 2:

- Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
- Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
- Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
 

#### Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length 32

### Think process:


```
n =110
n>>=1  // 110->1100
(n&1) // 1100 &1 = 0 
```

這題講到翻轉，可以理解為兩個數，其中一個數res不斷左移，另一B數不停右移，而Ｂ
數最一開始的digit（最右邊）會變到res數，隨著res左移，最終會變為res數的最左數，達到reverse的效果。

### Code


```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        if(n==0) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            res = res<<1; // 11->110
            if((n&1)==1){
                res = res+1;
            }
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```


```
Time:O(1) //因為for-loop run 32 times
Space:O(1)
```
