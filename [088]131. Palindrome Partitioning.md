>Given an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

>An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

#### Example 1:


```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]

Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:


```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

### Think process:

這題，我原先也是想到要拜訪dfs上下左右位置，但是我沒想到要把以便訪過的'1'，改為'0'，這樣才不會重複計算，另外還有超出邊界的錯誤排除跟遇到'0'的處理方式。

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    int m;
    int n;
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        m = grid.length;
        n = grid[0].length;
        if(m==0) return 0;
       
        int res =0;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(grid[i][j]=='1'){
                     dfs(grid, i, j);
                     res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j){
        // outBound condition
        if(i<0 || j<0 || i>=m || j>=n || grid[i][j]=='0'){
            return;
        }  
        //avoid mutiple counting
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid,i-1, j); //up
        dfs(grid,i+1,j); //down
        dfs(grid,i,j-1); //left
        dfs(grid,i,j+1); // right   
    }
}
```

- Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.97% of Java online submissions for Number of Islands.
- Memory Usage: 44.6 MB, less than 5.00% of Java online submissions for Number of Islands.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity : O(M×N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.

- Space complexity : worst case O(M×N) in case that the grid map is filled with lands where DFS goes by M×N deep.
