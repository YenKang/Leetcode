> There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

> The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 

#### Example 1:

- Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
- Output: 10
- Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
- Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
#### Example 2:

- Input: costs = []
- Output: 0
#### Example 3:

- Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
- Output: 2

### Think process:
本題是dp問題，從i==1開始run，每一層的min跟上一層的值有關係，for-loop起點從raw1開始，但是式子是跟raw0的element有關

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[][] costs) {
        if(costs==null || costs.length==0) return 0;
        for(int i=1;i<costs.length;i++){
            costs[i][0]+=Math.min(costs[i-1][1], costs[i-1][2]);
            costs[i][1]+=Math.min(costs[i-1][0], costs[i-1][2]);
            costs[i][2]+=Math.min(costs[i-1][0], costs[i-1][1]);
        }
        int n = costs.length;
        return Math.min(costs[n-1][0], Math.min(costs[n-1][1], costs[n-1][2]));
    }
}
```
