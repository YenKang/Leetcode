> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

#### Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
- Output: 4
- Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
- Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
#### Example 2:

- Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
- Output: 12
- Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
- Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 

#### Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

### Think process:
本題是dp的經典題型，相鄰的數就不能挑選，如果今天i要偷，就加上前兩天的最大值，並且跟(今天不偷＋昨天最大）


```java
dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
```

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums==null || nums.length==0) return 0;
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        dp[0]=nums[0];
        if(nums.length==1) return dp[0];
        
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0],nums[1]);
        if(nums.length==2) return dp[1];
        
        for(int i=2;i<nums.length;i++){
            dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[nums.length-1];
    }
}
```

### Complexity analysis

- Time complexity : O(n). Assume that nn is the number of houses, the time complexity is O(n).

- Space complexity : O(1).

- Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for House Robber.
- Memory Usage: 36.2 MB, less than 85.27% of Java online submissions for House Robber.
